CHANGES WITH 1:

        * Initial release of dbus-broker.

        * Contains dbus-broker, an independent D-Bus message broker
          implementation, which provides near perfect compatibility to the
          D-Bus reference implementation dbus-daemon(1).
          The broker binary is a pure bus implementation that does not depend
          on any external resources or environments. Rather it is controlled
          via a private control-connection from its parent process. This allows
          the parent to modify the broker at runtime, get notified of specific
          events, and control its lifetime.

        * The dbus-broker-launch application implements the D-Bus system and
          session bus compatible to dbus-daemon(1). It reads the known policy
          and service files, reacts to well-defined signals, and employs
          dbus-broker for the actual message passing.
